# Pix Qwen Image Edit (5 Images) 🐋

An enhanced Vision-Language Model (VLM) conditioning node for ComfyUI. This node is a powerful upgrade to the native `TextEncodeQwenImageEditPlus`, by ComfyUI, specifically designed for the **Qwen-Image** series.

It allows you to feed up to 5 reference images into the AI's "context window," giving you unprecedented control over character consistency, style transfer, and complex image editing.

## 🚀 Key Improvements Over Native Node

| Feature | Native ComfyUI Node | Pix Qwen Enhanced |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Image Slots** | 3 Images | **5 Images** |
| **System Prompt** | Hardcoded (Hidden) | **Fully Editable in UI** |
| **Assistant Priming** | None (Auto) | **Custom AI Response Starting** |
| **Token Tracking** | None | **Live UI Counter (Image + Txt)** |
| **Debug Outputs** | None | **Raw Prompt + Token Math String** |

## 🛠 Features Explained

### 1. Customizable System Instruction
The ComfyUI native node hides the instruction that tells the AI to "maintain consistency." 
In this node, the **SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION** is exposed.
*   **Consistency Mode (Default):** Use the default text to keep faces and clothes the same. Citing Qwen Techincal Paper.
*   **Creative Mode:** Remove the "maintain consistency" clause to let the AI be more imaginative with your reference images.

### 2. Assistant Priming
Control the "mood" of the AI. By typing in the **ASSISTANT_PRIMING** box, you are writing the first few words of the AI's response.
*   *Example:* Typing "A hyper-realistic 8k photo" forces the model to generate in that style immediately after reading your prompt.

### 3. Live Token Analytics
The node includes a word-wrapped display at the bottom that calculates your **Context Window** usage:
*   **Images (Image Tokens):** Each image consumes ~720-740 tokens (normalized to 384x384).
*   **Txt (Text Tokens):** The cost of your System Prompt, User Prompt, and Chat tags.
*   **Grand Total:** Monitor how much of the 32k context window you are using within this node.

## 💡 Bypass Logic & Best Practices

This node is designed to handle "Bypass" states intelligently. Whether you are saving VRAM or setting up a Negative Prompt, here is how the logic works:

### 🟢 Scenario 1: Bypassing the VAE Only
If you connect images but **disconnect/bypass the VAE input**:
*   **Result:** The model enters **"Concept Mode."** It "sees" the image via the low-res Vision Encoder (384px) but does not receive high-res "Reference Latents."
*   **Benefit:** Lower VRAM usage.
*   **CON:** Poor Outputs

### 🟡 Scenario 2: Bypassing Specific Images
If you have a `Load Image` node connected but **Bypass (Ctrl+B)** that image node:
*   **Result:** The node detects the "Empty Tensor" (0 pixels) and **completely removes** the reference (e.g., "Picture 3") from the prompt.
*   **Benefit:** No "Ghost Data." The AI won't get confused by trying to look at an image that isn't there.

### 🔴 Scenario 3: The "Negative Prompt" Strategy (Recommended)
When setting up your **Negative Conditioning**, you should bypass **ALL** images and the VAE.
*   **How to do it:** Use a second copy of this node for your negative input. Or Use the native ComfyUI node. Leave all image slots empty and the VAE disconnected.
*   **The Logic:** You want the **Positive** conditioning to have visual data, but the **Negative** conditioning to be "Blind" (Text-only). 
*   **The Benefit:** 
    1.  **VRAM Savings:** You aren't calculating all images (Ex. 5 pos + 5 neg), instead only 5 pos images.
    2.  **Cleaner Steering:** By using text-only negatives (e.g., "blurry, low quality"), the model knows exactly what to avoid without being distracted by visual references.
